Portfolio 1 
This file comprises of analysis of cycling and workout history from two different systems.

Portfolio 2 
This is something I treid to replicate the results of a research paper found at:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083 - Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house
I tried to replicate some of the plots and build models for prediction of energy usage in a small house.

Portfolio 3
I ahve tried to portray KNN algorithm in the portfolio. I am basically ttrying to generate some random points and then show how the algorithms maps the data points to differnet clusters at each iteration.
