Portfolio 1   
This file comprises of exploratory analysis of cycling and workout history from two different systems. The data from both systems was merged and tried to get some meaningful results from the data  .
  
Portfolio 2   
This is something I treid to replicate the results of a research paper found at:  
<font color = 'blue'>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083</font> - Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house  
I tried to replicate some of the plots and build models for prediction of energy usage in a small house.  
  
Portfolio 3  
I have tried to portray KNN algorithm in the portfolio. I am basically ttrying to generate some random points and then show how the     algorithms maps the data points to differnet clusters at each iteration.
