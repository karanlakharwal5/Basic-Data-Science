### Portfolio 1 - Analysis of cycling and workout data from mobile apps  
This file comprises of exploratory analysis of cycling and workout history from two different systems. The data from both systems was merged and tried to get some meaningful results from the data. This was the beginning phase of my data science journey where I tried to learn the basics of data visualizatoin with python.
  
### Portfolio 2  - Replicating the  outputs and charts of a research paper
In htis portfolio I tried to replicate the results of a research paper found at:  
<font color = 'blue'>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083</font> - Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house  
I tried to replicate some of the plots given in the paper from the dataset and build models for prediction of energy usage in a small house.  
  
### Portfolio 3  - Pseudo KNN algorithm
I have created a pseudo KNN algorithm in the portfolio. This was for a mate who was unable to grasp the logic of the KNN in class. I used this pseudo code to explain the KNN algo in lay man's terms and show how the algorithms maps the data points to differnet clusters at each iteration.
